I need a unicorn manager to keep track of my unicorns, so I'd like a flexible, easily used back-end system set up.
 
I have a pasture, a barn, and a corral
Unicorns may be kept in any of these locations. 
POST - I need the ability to add a new unicorn. 
PUT - I need to be able to move unicorns from one place to another. 
GET - I need to be able to see where all of my unicorns are.
This needs to be a fully-functional back end.
